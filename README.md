# CipherShell

## Overview
SecureExec is a secure client-server communication tool that allows remote command execution over an encrypted SSL connection. This tool is designed to provide a secure channel for running commands on a target machine and receiving output remotely. The server can send commands, and the client will execute them and return the results.

---

## Features

- **SSL Encryption**: All communication between the client and server is encrypted with SSL to ensure secure data transmission.
- **Remote Command Execution**: The server sends commands to the client, which executes them and returns the output.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on systems supporting Python and SSL (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Multithreading**: The server can handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **Command Output Handling**: Captures and sends back the output (or errors) from executed commands.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `ssl` module (built-in with Python)
- `socket` module (built-in with Python)
- (Optional) Server-side SSL certificate (`server.crt`, `server.key`)

To start the server, run the `server.py` file. The server listens for incoming client connections and allows you to send commands.

```bash
python server.py
